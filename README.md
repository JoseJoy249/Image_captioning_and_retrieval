# Image captioning and retreival
This project involves the code needed to build image captioning networks that can be used as a backbone to design an 
Image retrieval system that recommends images that are similar to the input image. Similarity is measured using Jaccard
similarity metric which uses captions (high level text representation of the image).

The original code for image captioning entwork was taken from following the repository
